  "body": "Your Google Business Profile is arguably the most important digital asset for local businesses. It's the first thing customers see when they search for your business or services in your area. Yet most businesses treat it as a set-it-and-forget-it profile.\n\nIn 2026, GBP optimization is more competitive and more important than ever. Here's how to get it right.\n\n## Why GBP Matters More Than Ever\n\nGoogle continues to prioritize local results. The map pack now appears in over 40% of all mobile searches, and GBP listings receive 5x more views than website results for local queries.\n\nWith AI Overviews now incorporating local business data, your GBP information also feeds into AI-generated local recommendations.\n\n## The Complete GBP Optimization Checklist\n\n### Business Information\n\n- **Business name:** Use your exact legal business name. Adding keywords is against guidelines and can get you suspended.\n- **Category:** Choose the most specific primary category available. Add all relevant secondary categories.\n- **Description:** Write a compelling 750-character description that naturally includes your key services and service area.\n- **Phone number:** Use a local phone number, not a toll-free number.\n- **Website:** Link to a location-specific landing page, not your homepage.\n\n### Visual Content\n\nBusinesses with photos receive 42% more direction requests and 35% more click-throughs to their websites.\n\n- Upload at least 10 high-quality photos covering your exterior, interior, team, and services\n- Add new photos monthly to signal activity\n- Use Google's photo categories to organize images\n- Consider adding short videos (under 30 seconds) showcasing your business\n\n### Reviews Strategy\n\nReviews are the second most important ranking factor for local search after proximity.\n\n- Implement a systematic review request process for every customer interaction\n- Respond to every review within 24 hours -- positive and negative\n- Use keywords naturally in your review responses\n- Aim for a steady stream of reviews rather than large bursts\n\n### Posts and Updates\n\nGBP posts keep your listing active and provide additional ranking signals.\n\n- Publish at least one post per week\n- Use a mix of offers, events, updates, and product highlights\n- Include a clear call-to-action in every post\n- Add relevant images to increase engagement\n\n### Q&A Section\n\nThe Q&A section is often overlooked but it's valuable real estate.\n\n- Proactively add and answer common questions about your business\n- Monitor for customer questions and answer promptly\n- Use questions as an opportunity to highlight key differentiators\n\n## Advanced GBP Tactics for 2026\n\n- **Service menu optimization:** Add every service you offer with detailed descriptions\n- **Product catalog:** If applicable, add your products with photos, descriptions, and pricing\n- **Messaging:** Enable messaging and respond within 5 minutes during business hours\n- **Booking integration:** Connect your booking system for direct appointment scheduling\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n- Keyword stuffing your business name\n- Using a virtual office address for service-area businesses\n- Ignoring negative reviews\n- Inconsistent NAP data across platforms\n- Neglecting to update hours for holidays\n\nGBP optimization isn't a one-time task. Set up a monthly review process to update photos, respond to reviews, publish posts, and ensure all information remains accurate.",
