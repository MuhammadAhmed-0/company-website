  "body": "If AEO (Answer Engine Optimization) is about getting cited in AI-generated answers, Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the broader discipline of ensuring your brand is visible, referenced, and recommended across all AI-powered search platforms.\n\nGEO takes a holistic view of your digital presence -- not just your website, but your entire digital ecosystem -- and optimizes it for the generative search era.\n\n## What Is Generative Engine Optimization?\n\nGenerative Engine Optimization is the practice of optimizing your brand's entire digital presence to appear in AI-generated search experiences. This includes Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT search, Perplexity, Microsoft Copilot, and emerging generative search platforms.\n\nWhile traditional SEO focuses on ranking web pages in link-based results, GEO focuses on how AI models perceive, process, and present your brand when generating responses to user queries.\n\n## How GEO Differs From Traditional SEO\n\nTraditional SEO and GEO share foundational principles but differ in key ways:\n\n- **Scope:** SEO optimizes your website. GEO optimizes your entire digital footprint -- website, social profiles, Wikipedia, Reddit mentions, industry directories, and any source AI models reference.\n- **Signals:** SEO relies on backlinks, keywords, and technical signals. GEO additionally considers brand mentions, entity relationships, source diversity, and cross-platform consistency.\n- **Output:** SEO aims for page rankings. GEO aims for brand visibility within AI-generated responses, citations, and recommendations.\n\n## The GEO Framework\n\nOur GEO framework has four pillars:\n\n### 1. Platform Mapping\n\nBefore optimizing, you need to understand where your audience encounters generative search. Map every platform where AI-generated responses might mention brands in your category. Test queries across Google AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, Copilot, and any industry-specific AI tools.\n\n### 2. Digital Ecosystem Audit\n\nAudit your brand's presence across all sources that AI models reference. This includes your website, but also Wikipedia, Reddit, Quora, industry forums, review sites, social media profiles, and directories. Identify gaps and inconsistencies.\n\n### 3. Content Authority Building\n\nCreate content that establishes your brand as the definitive authority on your key topics. This means comprehensive, data-rich, regularly updated content that AI models can confidently cite. Focus on original research, proprietary data, and expert perspectives.\n\n### 4. Cross-Platform Consistency\n\nEnsure your brand information is consistent and accurate across every digital touchpoint. AI models cross-reference multiple sources -- inconsistencies reduce confidence and citation likelihood.\n\n## Measuring GEO Performance\n\nGEO metrics extend beyond traditional SEO analytics:\n\n- **Multi-platform visibility score:** How often your brand appears in AI-generated responses across different platforms\n- **Citation quality:** Are you cited as a primary source, supporting source, or mentioned in passing?\n- **Recommendation frequency:** How often AI models recommend your brand when users ask for solutions\n- **Brand sentiment in AI:** How your brand is characterized in AI-generated responses\n\n## Getting Started With GEO\n\nStart with an audit of your current generative search visibility. Test 50-100 queries relevant to your business across major AI platforms and document where you appear, where competitors appear, and where neither shows up (these are your opportunities).\n\nFrom there, build a prioritized roadmap that addresses the highest-impact opportunities first. GEO is a long-term investment, but early movers will build significant advantages as generative search continues to grow.",
