  "body": "Core Web Vitals continue to be a meaningful ranking signal in 2026, and the metrics themselves have evolved. If you haven't revisited your CWV strategy recently, you're likely leaving rankings on the table.\n\nThis guide covers everything that's changed and provides actionable fixes for the most common issues.\n\n## What's New in 2026\n\nThe biggest change in 2026 is Google's continued emphasis on Interaction to Next Paint (INP) as the primary responsiveness metric, fully replacing First Input Delay (FID).\n\nINP measures the latency of all interactions during a page visit, not just the first one. This means your pages need to remain responsive throughout the entire user session -- not just on initial load.\n\n## The Current Benchmarks\n\n- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Good = under 2.5 seconds, Needs Improvement = 2.5-4s, Poor = over 4s\n- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP):** Good = under 200ms, Needs Improvement = 200-500ms, Poor = over 500ms\n- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Good = under 0.1, Needs Improvement = 0.1-0.25, Poor = over 0.25\n\n## LCP Optimization\n\nLCP is typically the easiest metric to improve and has the biggest impact on user experience.\n\n### Common LCP Issues\n\n- **Slow server response times:** Optimize your TTFB by upgrading hosting, implementing caching, and using a CDN\n- **Render-blocking resources:** Defer non-critical CSS and JavaScript\n- **Unoptimized images:** Use modern formats (WebP/AVIF), implement lazy loading, and serve responsive images\n- **Client-side rendering:** Pre-render or server-render critical content\n\n### Quick Wins\n\n- Preload your LCP image with `<link rel=\"preload\">`\n- Use `fetchpriority=\"high\"` on the LCP element\n- Inline critical CSS in the document head\n- Eliminate redirect chains\n\n## INP Optimization\n\nINP is the most challenging metric for complex web applications, especially those with heavy JavaScript.\n\n### Understanding INP\n\nINP captures the worst-case interaction latency your users experience. It considers clicks, taps, and keyboard interactions throughout the entire page session.\n\n### Common Causes of Poor INP\n\n- **Long JavaScript tasks:** Break up tasks longer than 50ms using `requestIdleCallback` or `scheduler.yield()`\n- **Heavy event handlers:** Debounce or throttle expensive event handlers\n- **Third-party scripts:** Audit and lazy-load third-party scripts that block the main thread\n- **DOM size:** Reduce the number of DOM nodes and simplify your layout\n\n## CLS Optimization\n\nCumulative Layout Shift measures visual stability. Unexpected layout shifts frustrate users and can hurt conversions.\n\n### Prevention Strategies\n\n- **Set explicit dimensions:** Always specify width and height on images and video elements\n- **Reserve space for ads:** Use min-height on ad containers\n- **Avoid inserting content above existing content:** Load new content below the viewport\n- **Use CSS `contain` property:** Isolate layout changes to specific containers\n- **Font loading:** Use `font-display: optional` or preload critical fonts to prevent layout shifts from font swaps\n\n## Measuring and Monitoring\n\nDon't rely solely on lab data. Field data from real users (CrUX data) is what Google uses for ranking purposes.\n\n- **Google Search Console:** Check the Core Web Vitals report for page-level field data\n- **PageSpeed Insights:** Get both lab and field data for specific URLs\n- **Chrome UX Report:** Access aggregated field data via BigQuery for competitive analysis\n- **Web Vitals library:** Implement real-user monitoring with Google's `web-vitals` JavaScript library\n\nCore Web Vitals optimization is a continuous process, not a one-time fix. Set up monitoring, establish baselines, and iterate. The sites that consistently maintain good CWV scores will see compounding benefits as Google continues to weight page experience in its ranking algorithms.",
