Instead of endless market‑research questionnaires, Prolific hosts university research studies. Participants might play behavioral games, give opinions on products or help train AI models. According to Prolific, there’s an £8 per hour minimum for tasks and payments are available daily through PayPal or direct deposit. This transparency sets Prolific apart from typical survey apps.\n\n**Pros:** Fair pay, interesting studies, quick cashouts. \n**Cons:** Approval queue & waitlist; limited task volume.\n\n### **2. UserTesting – Feedback on Websites and Apps**\n\nUserTesting pays you to review websites, apps and prototypes. You record your screen while describing what you like and what confuses you. Tests last 10–20 minutes and pay $10 or more depending on complexity. Payments go to PayPal roughly two weeks after completing a test. This is a great side hustle if you’re articulate and have a decent microphone.\n\n**Pros:** Higher pay than most survey sites; interesting tasks. \n**Cons:** Test availability fluctuates; requires clear spoken English.\n\n![best ](/uploads/split-bill-calculator-usefreecalculator.jpg \"Best Websites to Make Money Online\")\n\n### **3. User Interviews & Respondent – High‑Paying Research Calls**\n\nPlatforms like User Interviews and Respondent (often considered competitors) connect you with companies seeking detailed feedback. Studies range from one‑hour video calls to multi‑session product tests. According to various user reports, pay rates often range from $50 to $150 per hour, but you must pass a screener and slots fill up quickly. Payouts can vary by project and are usually via PayPal, gift cards or direct deposit. This category is ideal for professionals who have specific experience (marketing, finance, IT, etc.).\n\n**Pros:** Highest hourly rates among online research platforms. \n **Cons:** Competitive; not a consistent income source.\n\n### **4. PlaytestCloud – Test Mobile Games**\n\nIf you enjoy gaming, PlaytestCloud lets you get paid to test unreleased mobile games. Similar to UserTesting, you record your gameplay and share feedback. Pay is typically on a per‑test basis via Tremendous (exchangeable for PayPal or gift cards). While exact figures vary, many testers report earnings comparable to UserTesting—so it’s a fun way to monetize a hobby.\n\n**Pros:** Fun tasks; early access to games. \n**Cons:** Tests aren’t always available; pay varies by game.\n\n### **5. Honeygain – Passive Income by Sharing Your Internet**\n\n**[Honeygain](https://www.honeygain.com/)** is a unique passive‑income app that lets you earn money by sharing your unused internet bandwidth. You install the app and let it run in the background. It pays around $15–45 per month depending on the amount of data shared. Payouts are available once you reach $20 and can be redeemed via PayPal or Bitcoin.\n\n**Pros:** Completely passive; no tasks to complete. \n**Cons:** Slow earning rate; potential privacy concerns.\n\n### **6. Clickworker – Micro‑Tasks for AI and Data Projects**\n\nClickworker offers small digital tasks such as data entry, content categorization, product descriptions and AI data labeling. You choose tasks from a dashboard and complete them at your own pace. Earnings range from $8–$15 per hour depending on task complexity. Payouts happen weekly via PayPal or direct bank transfer once you hit the $10 threshold.\n\n**Pros:** Flexible schedule; tasks available globally. \n**Cons:** Task availability can be inconsistent; pay per task may be low.\n\n### **7. Toloka – AI Data Labeling and Voice Tasks**\n\nToloka is another platform for AI‑powered micro‑tasks. Operated by Yandex, it offers tasks like voice transcription, object labeling and search relevance evaluations. Pay rates are similar to Clickworker. The advantage is that Toloka has a reputation for fair compensation and operates in multiple regions. Payout options include Payoneer and QIWI. It’s ideal for those who want to contribute to AI projects while earning.\n\n**Pros:** Variety of tasks; supports global users. \n**Cons:** Requires accuracy; tasks can be repetitive.\n\n### **8. Swagbucks – Multi‑Task Rewards Platform**\n\nSwagbucks is a popular reward platform where you earn “SB” points by watching videos, taking surveys, playing games and shopping online. Points can be redeemed for gift cards or PayPal cash, and users who spend 10–25 minutes per day report earning $100–200 per month. It’s best for people who enjoy casual tasks and shopping cashback.\n\n**Pros:** Multiple earning methods; low cashout threshold. \n**Cons:** Points system can be confusing; some tasks pay very little.\n\n### **9. InboxDollars – Get Paid for Surveys and Small Tasks**\n\nInboxDollars works similarly to Swagbucks: you earn for surveys, reading emails, testing products and playing games. Tasks typically pay 25¢ to several dollars, and the site pays via check, gift cards or PayPal once you reach a balance of $15–$30. It’s easy to use and legitimate, but like most survey sites, earnings are modest.\n\n**Pros:** Simple interface; multiple payout options. \n**Cons:** Higher first cash‑out threshold; some surveys are long for low pay.\n\n### **10. Google Opinion Rewards – Quick Smartphone Surveys**\n\nGoogle Opinion Rewards sends short surveys based on your location history and search behavior. Each survey pays 10¢ to $1 and takes less than a minute. On Android, earnings are deposited as Google Play credit; on iOS, users may link a PayPal account. Because surveys are infrequent, this isn’t a reliable income source but it’s an easy way to earn small amounts of credit.\n\n**Pros:** Very quick tasks; no commitment. \n**Cons:** Surveys are sporadic; earnings mostly in credit rather than cash.",
